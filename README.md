# Conways-Game-of-Life
The form for an animation for the cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway

For those unfamiliar with the game, the explaination is as follows:
  It is contained in grid of rectangles, often squares.
  Each square can be one of two states, alive or dead.
  An initial seed input is given before simulation begins.
  Each generation, the state of each cell depends on its eight neighbors (the ones to the right, the left, the top, the bottom and the diagonals)
  If a cell is alive, and has only one living neighbor, or no living neighbors, it dies of lonelyness.
  If a cell is alive, and has four, or more living neighbors, it dies of overcrowding.
  A living cell that has two, or three living neighbors will live on to the next generation.
  A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors will become alive.
